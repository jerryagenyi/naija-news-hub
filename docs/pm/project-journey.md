## Introduction

In early 2025, I embarked on an ambitious project to solve a significant challenge in Nigerian news aggregation: the inconsistent and often inaccessible nature of news website structures. This blog post chronicles the journey of Naija News Hub from its initial concept to its current structured state.

## The Genesis: Identifying the Problem

The project began with a clear observation: Nigerian news websites, while rich in content, present unique technical challenges:

- Varying URL structures and formats
- Inconsistent sitemap implementations
- Dynamic article listings instead of traditional pagination
- Diverse website architectures
- Limited API access

These challenges made it difficult to create a reliable news aggregation system that could consistently and efficiently gather content from multiple sources.

## The Vision: Naija News Hub

The solution emerged as Naija News Hub - a sophisticated web scraping and news aggregation system designed to:

1. Automatically discover and validate article URLs
2. Handle diverse website structures
3. Extract and normalize article content
4. Provide a robust API for data access
5. Offer advanced features like LLM integration for research

## The Development Journey

### Phase 1: Documentation and Planning (February 2025)

The project started with comprehensive documentation:

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
   - Detailed system requirements
   - Feature specifications
   - Technical requirements
   - Future considerations

2. **Technical Design Document (TDD)**
   - System architecture
   - Component design
   - Database schema
   - API specifications

3. **Testing Checklist**
   - Unit testing requirements
   - Integration testing needs
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security considerations

### Phase 2: Project Structure (March 2025)

With the documentation in place, we established a robust project structure:

1. **Development Standards**
   - Python and TypeScript coding standards
   - Git workflow
   - Testing procedures
   - Documentation requirements

2. **Project Management Framework**
   - Task organization (Epics, Stories, Tasks)
   - Milestone planning
   - Progress tracking
   - Regular review processes

3. **Technical Infrastructure**
   - Directory structure
   - Configuration management
   - Environment setup
   - Deployment pipeline

## Key Decisions and Innovations

1. **Crawl4AI Integration**
   - Leveraging advanced web crawling capabilities
   - Implementing intelligent URL discovery
   - Handling dynamic content

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separating concerns into distinct components
   - Creating reusable utilities
   - Ensuring scalability

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit testing for all components
   - Integration testing for workflows
   - Performance testing for scalability

4. **Documentation-First Approach**
   - Clear documentation standards
   - Regular updates
   - Version control for documentation

## Current Status and Next Steps

As of April 2025, Naija News Hub has:

1. **Completed**
   - Comprehensive project documentation
   - Development standards
   - Project structure
   - Testing framework

2. **In Progress**
   - Initial setup implementation
   - Development environment configuration
   - Basic infrastructure setup

## Best Practices Adopted

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Filenames**
   - Using clear, descriptive filenames instead of abbreviations (e.g., `product-requirements-document.md` instead of `prd.md`)
   - Following consistent naming conventions with hyphens for filenames
   - Organizing documentation in logical directories (`docs/dev/`, `docs/pm/`, etc.)

2. **Consistent Date and Time References**
   - Using MCP time handling for consistent date references
   - Including "Last Updated" timestamps in documentation
   - Following YYYY-MM-DD format for all dates
   - Updating timestamps when making significant changes

3. **Documentation Synchronization**
   - Maintaining file relationship rules to ensure related files stay in sync
   - Updating all related documentation when making changes
   - Including cross-references between related documents

3. **Comprehensive Testing Documentation**
   - Creating both focused and enhanced testing checklists
   - Breaking down tests into detailed subtasks
   - Ensuring testing documentation aligns with development tasks

4. **Tracking Project Evolution**
   - Maintaining a dated project journey document
   - Recording key decisions and their rationales
   - Documenting best practices as they emerge

### Development Best Practices

1. **Database Management**
   - Creating comprehensive schema documentation with ERD
   - Documenting SQL creation scripts
   - Planning for database migrations and maintenance
   - Implementing proper indexing and performance considerations

2. **Task Management**
   - Breaking down tasks into manageable chunks
   - Using hierarchical task organization
   - Tracking progress with checklists
   - Organizing tasks by project phase

3. **Code Organization**
   - Following a modular architecture
   - Separating concerns into distinct components
   - Creating reusable utilities
   - Implementing proper error handling

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation is Crucial**
   - Clear documentation saves time in the long run
   - Standards ensure consistency
   - Version control for documentation is essential
   - Maintaining relationships between documents preserves integrity

2. **Planning Pays Off**
   - Detailed planning prevents rework
   - Clear structure enables parallel development
   - Well-defined milestones guide progress
   - Breaking down tasks makes complex projects manageable

3. **Flexibility is Key**
   - Adapting to changing requirements
   - Incorporating new technologies
   - Maintaining scalability
   - Evolving documentation as the project grows
