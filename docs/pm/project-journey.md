## Introduction

In early 2025, I embarked on an ambitious project to solve a significant challenge in Nigerian news aggregation: the inconsistent and often inaccessible nature of news website structures. This blog post chronicles the journey of Naija News Hub from its initial concept to its current structured state.

## The Genesis: Identifying the Problem

The project began with a clear observation: Nigerian news websites, while rich in content, present unique technical challenges:

- Varying URL structures and formats
- Inconsistent sitemap implementations
- Dynamic article listings instead of traditional pagination
- Diverse website architectures
- Limited API access

These challenges made it difficult to create a reliable news aggregation system that could consistently and efficiently gather content from multiple sources.

## The Vision: Naija News Hub

The solution emerged as Naija News Hub - a sophisticated web scraping and news aggregation system designed to:

1. Automatically discover and validate article URLs
2. Handle diverse website structures
3. Extract and normalize article content
4. Provide a robust API for data access
5. Offer advanced features like LLM integration for research

## The Development Journey

### Phase 1: Documentation and Planning (February 2025)

The project started with comprehensive documentation:
