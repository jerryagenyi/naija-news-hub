# Naija News Hub - Project Overview

## Project Goal
To develop a robust, adaptable, and scalable system for aggregating news content from a diverse range of Nigerian online news sources, despite the inherent challenges of inconsistent website structures and accessibility. This system will facilitate comprehensive data collection, analysis, and ultimately, enable researchers and users to interact with the aggregated information through an intelligent, LLM-powered interface.
