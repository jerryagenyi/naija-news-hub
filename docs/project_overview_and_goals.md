# Project Overview (Refined)

**Project Goal:** To develop a robust, adaptable, and scalable system for aggregating news content from a diverse range of Nigerian online news sources, despite the inherent challenges of inconsistent website structures and accessibility. This system will facilitate comprehensive data collection, analysis, and ultimately, enable researchers and users to interact with the aggregated information through an intelligent, LLM-powered interface.

**Simple Descriptor:** Nigerian News Aggregation & Analysis Platform

**Key Objectives:**

* **Universal URL Acquisition:** Implement a multi-faceted approach to reliably extract article URLs from a minimum of 28 identified news websites, accommodating both sitemap-driven and dynamic, pagination-based content structures.  
* **Content Extraction & Normalization:** Develop a flexible scraping mechanism capable of accurately extracting key article metadata (title, author, publication date, categories, content) from diverse HTML structures, with the potential for LLM-assisted element identification.  
* **Data Integrity & Reliability:** Ensure data accuracy and consistency through rigorous URL validation, error logging, and automated monitoring for content updates and website changes.  
* **Scalable Architecture:** Design a modular system that can easily accommodate new news sources and evolving website structures, leveraging cloud-based infrastructure and efficient data storage.  
* **Intelligent Data Interaction:** Integrate an LLM-powered interface to enable natural language querying and analysis of the aggregated news content, providing valuable insights to researchers and users.  
* **Automation & Maintenance:** Implement automated processes for continuous URL discovery, content updates, and error resolution, leveraging tools like n8n for workflow orchestration.

**Key Considerations for Success:**

* **Robust Error Handling:** Anticipate and address the challenges of inconsistent website structures, dynamic content loading, and potential website changes through comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms.  
* **Adaptable Scraping Logic:** Design a flexible system that can be easily adapted to new website structures and changes in existing ones, potentially incorporating machine learning for dynamic element identification.  
* **Efficient Data Storage & Retrieval:** Optimize data storage and retrieval for performance and scalability, considering the large volume of data and the need for efficient LLM-based querying.  
* **Ethical Scraping Practices:** Adhere to ethical scraping guidelines, respecting website terms of service and avoiding excessive requests that could overload servers.  
* **Maintenance and Monitoring:** Implement a robust monitoring system to detect and address website changes, errors, and performance issues proactively.  
* **LLM Integration:** choose a suitable LLM and vector database.  
* **Data Validation:** Ensure all extracted urls are valid before storing.
