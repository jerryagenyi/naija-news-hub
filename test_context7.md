# Testing Context7 MCP Server Connection

This is a test file to check if the Context7 MCP server is properly connected to VS Code.

If Context7 is working correctly, you should be able to:
1. See documentation for various libraries and frameworks
2. Get context-aware information about your codebase
3. Access documentation without leaving VS Code

## Test Query
Try asking about a common programming concept like "React hooks" or "Python decorators" to see if Context7 can retrieve documentation.
